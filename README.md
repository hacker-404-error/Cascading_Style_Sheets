## CSS Syntax
<br>
<div align="center">
    <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/css/img_selector.gif" alt="Syntax">
</div>
<br>

```
The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
```
